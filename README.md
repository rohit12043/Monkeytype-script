Fun little script for automating the monkeytype typing test, It uses Selenium webdriver to scrape the text and send it to the browser.
It is only a POC project, there is no intention to promote unfair methods of bypassing or cheating.

Features:
Random wait time before sending the keys.
Time config can be selected from the cmdline.
